      <img src="mindmap.png" alt="Professional passions mind map">
      <p class="note">
        This mind map illustrates the foundational pillars of my professional passions, including my dream
        career, strengths, values, role models, and long-term goals in the hospitality and theme park industry.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Professional Passions Summary</h2>

      <p>
        My professional passions are rooted in relaxation, travel, and leisure—experiences that help me feel
        grounded, balanced, and fulfilled. These interests naturally connect to the hospitality and tourism
        industry, where my goal is to help others experience joy, comfort, and memorable moments in the
        places they visit.
      </p>

      <p>
        My dream career is to work in management at a theme park, specifically Walt Disney World.
        I am open to different functional areas within the parks, but I am especially drawn to roles in
        merchandise and attractions, as these areas often have the greatest impact on guests’ excitement and
        enjoyment. These environments reflect the types of guest experiences I hope to support and create.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on my passions, several career options align with my strengths and interests, including travel
        agent, tour guide, resort planner, theme park employee, hotel worker, concierge, and flight attendant.
        All of these roles involve helping people explore new places, enjoy leisure time, and navigate travel
        or entertainment spaces—areas where I feel motivated and energized.
      </p>

      <p>
        My core values guide the direction of my career. Flexibility, responsibility, and freedom are central
        to the way I work and the way I envision my future. Flexibility and freedom allow me to take ownership
        of my journey and choose opportunities that align with my long-term goals. Responsibility is equally
        important to me; I believe that following through on commitments is essential for building trust and
        maintaining personal and professional success, and this is a value I am not willing to compromise.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also have clear career goals that connect to both my long-term aspirations and my current experience.
        In the short term, I aim to continue working at SeaWorld and transition from seasonal entertainment
        roles into a more stable position in merchandise or attractions. In the longer term, I hope to return
        to the Walt Disney World College Program and move into a part-time or full-time role in attractions or
        merchandise, eventually progressing toward leadership within the company.
      </p>

      <p>
        My top strength is my ability to follow and apply instructions accurately. Once I understand how
        something should be done, I am able to replicate it reliably and complete tasks in the way people
        expect. At the same time, I am committed to developing a desired strength—improving my social skills.
        I want to become more comfortable initiating conversations, engaging in casual dialogue, and building
        stronger networking abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        My role models also influence my growth. My mom inspires me with her ability to stay calm and
        compassionate when dealing with difficult people. My dad is someone I admire for his natural
        confidence in social situations and his talent for networking. My aunt demonstrates strong
        communication skills, especially her ability to break down instructions into clear, detailed steps.
        They all approach communication differently, but each of them models a skill that I want to better
        develop in myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, my passions, strengths, values, and role models form the foundation of the career I am
        building in the hospitality, tourism, and theme park industries. These elements guide my decisions,
        motivate my growth, and shape the professional path I am working toward.
